# BikeSharing Analysis

## Project Overview:

NYC Citibike riding analysis is to analyze the number of rides that happen during the peak months and help to go through the findings that will provide answers to most of the common questions investors  will have to start or invest in a similar kind of company in Des Moines, Iowa.
For analysis purposes we've used the 2019 August Month's data for analysis and building the vizualisation.

### Technologies:
 1.Tableau
 2.Python

1. Checkout Time (trip Duration) of All Riders: This visualization will tell us that the most of the riders around 150K users check out for a maximum of 6 minutes during the zero hr. <br/>

2. Checkout Time (trip duration) By Gender: By looking at this visualization we can answer the Males are the most common riders who ride during zero hour of the day. The number of male riders are around 106 who checkouts for 6 min duration, while female riders are around 33K. <br/>

3. Trips by Weekday for Each Hour: In this visualization we are answering what are the most common hrs that riders usually start riding during the day of the week. <br/>

4. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): This visualization is same as the above one, with slight variation by using the Gender Category. This will help us to arrange the bikes that are mostly liked by the females according to their tastes and likings too.<br/>

5. User trips by Gender by Weekday: we are analyzing the rider types (subcribers vs customer) who are riding the most for each weekday.<br/>

6. August Peak Hours: In order to answer what are the peak hours for each day, we use the start time and number of riders to make this visualization. <br/>

7. Top Starting Location: In this visualization helps us to answer the top start location of the rides

## Summary

The dashboard will give overview of the bike riding in NYC during one of the peak months of the year i.e August. By looking at the dashboard we are going to answer some of the commonly asked questions like Checkout Duration, Number of Riders by Gender, Number of rides per User Type , Peak Hours, Top location of the Start of the Ride, Rides by Weekday.  In order to get little more understanding in order to start the BikeSharing Ride company, additional visualizations like 
1. Equipment  Maintenance: This will helps us to know how many times the same bikes are due for Maintenance, also how much duration the bikes will take to get ready for bike riding.
2. Overall ride count by Month helps to understand how is the ride usages in different months.
